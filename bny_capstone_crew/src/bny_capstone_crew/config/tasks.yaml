discussion_1:
  description: >
    Get a vote from every single agent in the crew on whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the Federal Funds Target Rate by increments of 25 basis points (bps). Remind each agent to keep the attached knowledge sources in mind while making their vote. Each agent’s answer should reference specific statistics and compare to historical examples, and specifying the time periods it is considering when making their vote. Also, get a prediction from each agent on what they expect the Federal Funds Target Rate to be at the end of 2025. No reasoning is required for the prediction at the end of 2025. Do not allow for a range in the predictions, ask for specific values.
  expected_output: >
    A short summary with A vote from each agent on whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the Federal Interest Rate by increments of 25 basis points (bps) and the reasoning behind it with mention of the most popularly compared time periods and specific metrics that the agents discussed. Then the entirety of each agent’s reasoning must be repeated in the final output. Finally, a list of exactly what each individual agent predicted the Federal Funds Target Rate to be at the end of 2025.
discussion_2:
  description: >
    Get a vote from every single agent in the crew on whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the Federal Interest Rate by increments of 25 basis points (bps). Remind each agent to keep the attached knowledge sources in mind while making their vote, as well as the output from discussion_1. Each agent’s answer should reference specific statistics and compare to historical examples, and specifying the time periods it is considering when making their vote. When asking each agent, include the entire output from discussion_1 in the question. Each Agent should also reference at least one point made by a different crew member during the first discussion. Also, get a prediction from each agent on what they expect the Federal Funds Target Rate to be at the end of 2025. No reasoning is required for the prediction at the end of 2025. Do not allow for a range in the predictions, ask for specific values.

summary_3:
  description: >
    Get a vote from every single agent in the crew on whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the Federal Interest Rate by increments of 25 basis points (bps). Remind each agent to keep the attached knowledge sources in mind while making their vote as well as past discussion rounds. When asking each agent, the entire output from discussion_2 should be included in the question. Each agent’s answer should reference specific statistics and, compare to historical examples, and specifying the time periods it is considering when making their vote. Finally, summarize these votes for a final decision and one explanation of the agent’s reasoning, citing specific numerical metrics and relevant historical time periods. Also, get a prediction from each agent on what they expect the Federal Funds Target Rate to be at the end of 2025. No reasoning is required for the prediction at the end of 2025. Do not summarize the end-of-year predictions. Return a list of exactly what each individual agent predicted. Do not allow for a range in the predictions, give specific values.
  expected_output: >
    A vote from each agent on whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the Federal Interest Rate by increments of 25 basis points (bps) and the reasoning behind it, citing specific numerical metrics and relevant historical time periods for each member. Also, a list of exactly what each individual agent predicted the Federal Funds Target Rate to be at the end of 2025.
summary_4:
  description: >
    Take the output from summary_3 and condense it to a json file summary without "```json" or "```". The json file should be in the following format: 1. Exact historical dates referenced, these should be explicit year ranges, no other words 2. Exact metrics mentioned, 3. A list of every single member’s rate vote, in the form of the percentage change in rate, meaning a vote to maintain is 0.00% (do not leave any members out), 4. A list of every single member’s rate prediction for 2025, do not leave any member"s votes out.
  expected_output: >
    A summary in json format as follows: {"exact_historical_dates_referenced": ["year1-year2", "year3-year4",..., "year-year"], "exact_metrics_mentioned": ["Metric 1", "Metric 2",..., "Metric n"], "rate_votes": [{"member": "member_name1", "vote": "0.00%"}, {"member": "member_name2", "vote": "-0.25%"},..., {"member": "member_name3", "vote": "0.25%"}], "rate_predictions": [{"member": "member_name1", "prediction": "3.25-3.5%"},{"member": "member_name2", "prediction": "3.00-3.25%"},..., {"member": "member_name3", "prediction": "2.75-3.00%"}],} every single one of the 3 members should be included in rate_votes and rate_predictions.
